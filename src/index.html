    <p>
      Hi, I am Saptak S. 
      I'm a Freelance Web Developer (Frontend & Backend).
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently working as a contractor with Freedom of the Press Foundation.
      I have been an active contributor and maintainer in various different 
      Open Source projects and organisations. 
      Weblate, OONI, Onionshare are some of the projects I am actively upstream contributing to.
      I have previously worked with other open source organisations and projects like 
      FOSSASIA, jQuery, Securedrop, Wagtail, etc to name a few.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can probably find me in various different conferences all over the world. Sometimes I give
      talks and write blogs about things I have recently worked on or tips that have helped me.
